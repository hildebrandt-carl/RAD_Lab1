# Project Title

Advanced Embedded Systems - Lab 1

## About

This lab was setting up two wizzimote to send and recieve strings. Wizzimotes provide low-power communication, and will be used in a larger system during the rest of this course. We are using a cc430 microprocessor and a ported version of Contiki. The native version of Contiki is not compatible with the cc430 platform.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install wizzimote-contiki:

git clone https://suman2135@bitbucket.org/suman2135/wizzimote-contiki.git

Move the libmsp430.so into /usr/lib

Once this is installed you will need multiple packages for compliting and running Contiki. They can be installed using:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential binutils-msp430 gcc-msp430 msp430-libc msp430mcu mspdebug gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi ant libncurses5-dev
```
